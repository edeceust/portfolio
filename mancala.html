<h2>A Simple Overview of Mancala Rules</h2>
<p>
While there are some variations of the rules depending on the mancala game, these are the steps you should follow to play a "basic" game. For the purposes of this article, the player pieces are referred to as seeds and the six spots on each player row as pits.
</p>
<h3>Taking Turns</h3>
<p>
   Player one takes all the seeds in a pit in his row and places them, one by one in consecutive order, in the next sequential pits.
       In other words, if you are playing a game with three seeds in each pit, you can choose any pit in your row to take the seeds from.
       You must then place the seeds in each successive pit until the seeds are used up - no skipping! You are moving in a counter-clockwise direction.
   If the last seed you play ends up in your mancala, then you go again. That seed also stays in your mancala.
   Player two then goes and repeats the same step.
   Note than when moving pieces along the board, each player only uses their own mancala. The other player will skip over the other player's mancala when moving their seeds around the board.
</p>
<h3>Capturing Pieces</h3>
<p>
   During a player's turn they may end up placing their last seed in an empty pit on their side of the board, they then "capture" the other player's seeds on the opposite side of the row. In other words, these would be the seeds in the pit directly opposite the pit on their side.
   All of the other player's seeds that have been captured are then put in the player's mancala.
   If a player's last seed lands in an empty pit on the other player's side of the board, they do not capture the other player's seeds.
</p>
<h3>Ending the Game</h3>
<p>
   The game is over when a player has cleared all of their seeds from their side of the board and moved them into their mancala.
   The other player will remove any seeds left on his side of the board and puts into his mancala.
   The game is then scored to determine the winner.
</p>
<h3>Scoring the Game</h3>
<p>
   Each player counts up the seeds in their mancala.
   The player with the most seeds wins.
